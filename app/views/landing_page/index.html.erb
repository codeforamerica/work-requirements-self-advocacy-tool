<h2>What are the SNAP work rules?</h2>

<p>People who have to follow the SNAP work rules must do at least 80 hours of work activities a month or earn at least $935.25 a month.</p>

<p>Work activities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working a job for money, including self-employment or gigs</li>
  <li>Working in exchange for something like food, housing, or other services</li>
  <li>Volunteering</li>
  <li>Participating in job training or SNAP Employment & Training programs</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not do work activities for 80 hours a month, you can only get SNAP benefits for up to 3 months every 3 years (36 months).</p>
