          keep_snap_content_html: |
            <p>If you do not need to follow the SNAP work rules, you can keep getting SNAP benefits as usual, as long as your state knows about your exemption.</p>
            <p>Reporting your exemption to your state helps prevent your benefits from being cut off by accident.</p>
            <p>If you do need to follow the SNAP work rules, you must do 80 hours a month of work activities each month. If you don’t, you can only get SNAP benefits for up to 3 months every 3 years (36 months).</p>
            <strong>This form will help you figure out if you have to follow the SNAP rules or not.</strong>

          unfit: What if I’m unfit for work?
          unfit_content_html: 'If you can show that you can’t work for a medical or health reason, the SNAP work rules do not apply to you and you can keep getting SNAP. If you can’t work that month for a good reason (e.g.: your car broke down, a family emergency), you can get excused for that month.'
          who: Who has to follow the SNAP work rules?

            This law requires most states and counties to enforce the Able-Bodied Adult Without Dependents work rules, and expands who has to follow those rules. Prior to the law being passed, many states and counties were able to waive this requirement for SNAP recipients.
